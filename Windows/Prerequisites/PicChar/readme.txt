       Wiggle your dick in a public place: Picchar 0.13 by Silicon Ltd.


- SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS -
 
- A multimediavirtualrealitycyberspaceinternetgroovy-computer
  running Windows Whatever or Linux with Wine.

- NOTES - 

  Remember those tools which converted your hires/koala pictures into a
  charset?
  Yeah, those so called 'CharWandlers'.

  PicChar does the same thing for you. 
  Only this time on your Windows PC and instead of converting 1 picture into
  a charset, PicChar enables you to convert up to 8 pictures into 1 charset which might
  come in handy when doing animations using charsets.
  The tool is pretty straightforward. 
  The only thing should know is about the Save Fix option.

  Normally, the 2 first bytes of a C=64 program contain the hi and lo pointer
  of the memory-location where the file should be loaded.
  If you want to use the converted pictures on a real C=64 or emulator,
  you should turn the Save Fix option *OFF*! Then those 2 bytes will be saved
  with the file.

  By default the Save Fix-option is *ON* (so no 2 heading bytes,
  remember that!) because I mainly made this tool for cross-development users
  and I found those 2 heading bytes quite annoying.
  
  The only improvement in this version is that it is possible to create an
  inverted charset too. So no need for eor #$ff's in your sourcecode to invert
  the charset yourself.
  
  Oh, before I forget. PicChar spits out a maximum of 9 different files;
  *.chr and *.sc?
  Where the *.chr is the charset and *.sc? are the screens (? equals
  the picturenumber loaded in memory).

  Well, I guess that's about it.
  If you find any bugs, have requests or whatever, contact me at csdb and leave me
  a PM.
